					content creators
				</div>
				<div>
					The companies only want money, so they incentivize creating content that gets the most ad
					viewsâ€”clickbait garbage that users don't actually enjoy because the platforms just want us
					to scroll or click the next video, and watch another ad.

					We're sick of it. So we're giving the power back to the users, because we love the
